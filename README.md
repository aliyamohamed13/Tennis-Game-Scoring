# Tennis-Game-Scoring
#### To view project locally at https://localhost:3000, git clone and in terminal run: node app.js

#### Behavior Tested Directly:
  1. On load, both players start at 0
  2. First two scores should increment by 15, then by 10 until score of 40
  3. If both players tie, at of after score of 40, "Deuce" shows above
  4. If tie is broken, "Player X has advantage" shows above
  5. Scores for round don't exceed 40 (after that either player has won, has advantage or at deuce)
  6. Reset button clears both players scores to 0
  7. After a player has won, and text appears saying that they have, any consectutive button click will reset scores
